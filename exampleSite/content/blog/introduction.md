Welcome at this far corner of the internet. 

My name is Daan Asma and I've taken the liberty to be your host for the time being. We'll see how that works out. Things might still seem a bit messy, it sure feels like that to me, but I imagine that will solve itself along the way. I decided it was more important to start writing. I'll fix the details later. 
I've noticed you have some questions for me. Well, it's not like there's that much going on right now, so I'll try my best to answer them.

So. Firstly. Why? Why did I think the world was in desperate need of yet another blog? 
I don't have the impression that there is a lack of information, opinions and entertainment. The internet is a never ending whirpool which provides with all of these things. I know that because I've been sucked into it many, many times - often leaving me stranded somewhere on the shores of "things-you-didnt-know-and-its-maybe-better-to-keep-it-that-way-island". 
Despite of - and maybe because of - the vastness of this information web, I have found it often very insightfull to read peoples ideas, points of views and ways of thinking. Well, very often these works are summaries and combinations of other peoples insights, but in a way that's actually a great thing. Old concepts in a different light can make them accessible   By no means I'm a  

So I think the most important reason is: "Because I felt like it". 


Another question you might have: "Daan, you're not a native English speaker, so why did you decide to write in English?".
Fair point. Even though I think I've reached a quite decent level in *The Common Tongue*, expressing myself in my native language (Dutch) would prove to be a bit less complicated. However, I chose English because it allows me to share my writings with more people. We'll let them decide whether that's a good or a bad thing. Also, since I'm not living in Belgium (or the Netherlands) at the moment, people who speak Dutch are a rare species around me. But maybe the most important reason is that the subjects that interest me the most can not be confined within the small linguistical borders of *The Low Countries*.
