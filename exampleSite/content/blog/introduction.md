Welcome at this far corner of the internet. 

My name is Daan Asma and I've taken the liberty to be your host for the time being. We'll see how that works out. Things might still seem a bit messy, they sure feel like that to me, but we'll figure that out along the way. It's a bit like moving to a restored house before painting the interior. You would have rather enjoyed drinking your morning coffee admiring that *charcoal grey* or *North Sea blue* wall, but a white and slightly damaged wall still beats the 70s style of your parents-in-laws kitchen. 
It was time to get going.

I've noticed you have some questions for me. Well, it's not like there's that much going on right now, so I'll try my best to answer them.

So. Firstly. Why? Why did I think the world was in desperate need of yet another blog? 
I don't have the impression that there is a lack of information, opinions and entertainment. The internet is a never ending whirpool flooded with all of these things (and so much more). I know this because I've been sucked into it many, many times - often leaving me stranded somewhere on the shores of "things-you-didnt-know-and-its-maybe-better-to-keep-it-that-way-island" at 3 o'clock in the morning. 
Because of the vastness of this information web, it's often challenging for me to create a good overview image of a certain topic or idea. There are so much valuable ideas and concepts readily available but for me the hard part is to find, interpret, filter and combine these things in my own interpretation of the world. 
In this search, it has been very helpful to read into other peoples ideas, points of views and ways of thinking. Nearly always, these works are in a way combinations of yet again other peoples insights. But that's in a way the beauty of how our collective human intelligence works. Not only can a combination of separate ideas result in new realisations, simply explaining something in other words or with a colorful metafor might help someone to better understand the concept that's being discussed. 

However, I've experienced that there is a large gap between 
"Oh yeah this article/book I just read makes total sense and now I know this vaguely" and "Allright, let me explain how it works and why it happens." Earlier, I mentioned the overload of (unstructured) information on the internet. Sometimes I experience a similar sensation inside my own head. When I'm involved in a conversation or a discussion about an interesting topic, I can get quite excited because there a lot I want to say and in my mind it all makes sense. However, when I actually start talking, it's often very hard to exactly express how I think or feel.

I've experienced that writing helps me a lot in *clearing up this internal fog* and transforming my thought cloud to a more understandable whole - both for others and for myself. Whilst writing, I often discover assumptions and patterns that I would have missed otherwise. The process of putting it on paper helps me polish my thoughts and give me a better understanding of what's going on. And in its turn, that helps me in expressing what I think and how I feel.

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Albert Einstein

Also, I enjoy writing. A lot.

Another question you might have: "Daan, you're not a native English speaker, so why did you decide to write in English?".
Fair point. Even though I think I've reached a quite decent level in *The Common Tongue*, expressing myself in my native language (Dutch) would probably prove to be a bit less complicated. However, I chose English because it allows me to share what I create with a larger audience. Since I'm currently not living in Belgium (or the Netherlands), Dutch speaking people are a rare species around me. Also, I intensely enjoy learning languages and their small details that make all of the difference. I'm fairly sure that publishing in English (and thus exposing myself) will help me grow in this. And I'll have fun along the way.

"What will you write about?", you ask. Another good question! To tell you the truth, I don't really know yet. My interests are very broad and I have found myself being curious about a lot of different subjects. A few things that come to mind are:

- The interaction between humans and our environment;
- The question whether we as humans inhabit our environment or are a part of it;
- Daily life experiences with mental models;
- What makes traveling by bicycle so special? 
- How do we build our opinions on anything? 
- What can be the future of the internet?
- The importance of what is not being said;
- How can we get to know ourselves and each other better?
- Digital privacy
- The impact of false dillemma's, where we (falsely) assume there are only two possible answers to a statement
- What is the goal of life (this might be a long term project)
- Living a simple life

Well... That's going to be quite eclectic. Anyway, I'm looking forward to see where this ship will bring me and I hope that you - my reader - can also benefit from my writing journey. In whatever way.

If you have any questions, suggestions, concerns or just something you want to share, don't hesitate to drop me a line here.

If you want to stay tuned on what happens here, you are very welcome to join this shiny new mail list.

See you soon!
